title: About Me

Hola! I am a master student majoring artificial intelligence engineering in **Carnegie Mellon University**. I expect to graduate in December 2024. Before this, I completed my Bachelor's degree with a major in Mathematics as well as Finance at *Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University* (China) and *Liverpool University* (UK). My research interests lie around **Embodied AI**, especially for Vision and Language Navigation, Social Navigation, VL-Action Foundation Model. In addition, due to my curiosity, I am exploring the world model, Transformer's mechanical interpretability, and a bit about the phenomenon of neural collapse caused by regularization and smoothing.

## Current News

- \[12/2024\] We propose [MaxSup: Fixing Label Smoothing for Improved Feature Representation]() , a simple and elegant correction method for label smoothing to provide consistent regularization effects, thereby improving the feature space collapse caused by label smoothing. 
- \[10/2024\] We propose [HA-VLN: Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation](), a visual language navigation task in a unified discrete and continuous environment, to advance the research on social navigation in human-intensive environments in real world.
- \[09/2024\] [Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation: Bridging Simulation to Reality with Dynamic Human Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19236) is accepted by _**NeurIPS**_ as _**Spotlight**_ paper. 
- \[07/2024\] We propose  [Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation: Bridging Simulation to Reality with Dynamic Human Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19236) The agent should learn to navigate in environments with people rather than ignore Sim2Real. We found that all SOTA agents find it difficult to navigate in simple, populated environments.
