Hello! I'm Heng(Dylan) Li, and this is my spokgen🌲. **THE SPOKGEN GATHERS ALL MY THOUGHTS AND WRITINGS** on topics including AI Research (See [[research]] for more details), self-management, and a fulfilling life. For a more formal introduction to me, please see [[aboutme]].

Writing brings me an immense amount of joy—seriously, it’s borderline therapeutic (See [[posts]] for more details). This website started as a tool for my doctoral application, but then I thought, “Hey, why not use this space to learn some front-end development?” So, here I am, dabbling in TailwindCSS, and TypeScripts, all while trying not to break the internet. (Spoiler: It's not as easy as it looks.)

I’ve also got a little secret mission on the side: migrating my chaotic collection of thoughts and ideas from Notion onto this site. It’s like transferring a lifetime of sticky notes into something that won’t vanish the moment I knock over my coffee cup. But, let’s be real—this is no small task. We’re talking about three years' worth of ideas that need to be carefully moved over. I’m thinking of using some fancy scripts to help bridge the gap between Notion’s unique style and Obsidian’s Markdown formatting. The goal? To create a digital archive that’s as visually captivating as it is everlasting. I'm essentially building an intellectual fortress—or at least a library so sleek, it might make the Library of Alexandria jealous.
